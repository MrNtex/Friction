Stop the muscle memory.

This extension introduces a brief pause to think about your life choices before you start doomscrolling. It forces a customizable delay on distracting domains, giving you a second chance to be productive.

I built this because hard blockers never worked for me. Whenever a friend sent me a link or I needed to look up something specific, I ended up disabling the blocker entirely just to see it.
This extension solves that by adding friction, not walls. It’s smart enough to let you visit specific pages (like a specific video or post) without opening the floodgates to the main feed.
